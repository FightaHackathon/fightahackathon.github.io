                    <p>Nuclear fission produces various types of radiation, including:

                        <br>1.Gamma Radiation
                        <br>2.Neutron Radiation

                    <p>
                        Gamma radiation is a type of electromagnetic radiation that is highly energetic and penetrating. It is emitted during various nuclear processes, including nuclear fission and decay of radioactive isotopes. Here are some key details about gamma radiation:
                        <br>1. Electromagnetic Spectrum: Gamma radiation belongs to the electromagnetic spectrum, which includes other forms of radiation such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared radiation, visible light, ultraviolet radiation, and X-rays. Gamma rays have the shortest wavelength and highest frequency among all electromagnetic radiations.

                        <br>2. Penetration: Gamma rays have high energy and are extremely penetrating. They can easily pass through air, paper, clothing, and even dense materials like lead and concrete. The high penetration ability of gamma radiation makes it a significant concern in terms of radiation exposure and requires appropriate shielding for protection.
                        <br> 3. Ionizing Radiation: Like alpha and beta radiation, gamma radiation is also ionizing radiation. It can remove tightly bound electrons from atoms, creating charged particles (ions) in the process. This ionization can damage biological tissues and materials, posing health risks.
                        <br>4. Energy Transfer: When gamma rays interact with matter, they transfer energy to the atoms and molecules they encounter. This energy deposition can cause damage to cells, DNA, and other biological molecules, leading to potential health effects.
                        <br> 5. No Mass or Charge: Unlike alpha and beta particles, gamma rays have no mass or charge. They are pure energy and do not carry an electric charge. This characteristic allows them to travel long distances without being deflected by electric or magnetic fields.
                        <br>6. Detection and Measurement: Gamma radiation can be detected and measured using specialized instruments such as Geiger-Muller counters, scintillation detectors, or gamma spectrometers. These instruments can provide information about the intensity and energy of the gamma radiation present.\
                        <br>7. Medical and Industrial Applications: Gamma radiation has various applications in medicine, industry, and research. It is used in cancer treatment (radiation therapy), sterilization of medical equipment, food irradiation, and non-destructive testing in industries such as manufacturing, oil and gas, and nuclear power.
                        <br>8. Radiation Protection: Shielding materials with high atomic numbers, such as lead or concrete, are used to block or attenuate gamma radiation. The thickness of the shielding material required depends on the energy and intensity of the gamma radiation. Proper shielding and safety protocols are essential to minimize exposure to gamma radiation.

These new neutrons can cause more U-235 to split, and the process keeps repeating. So, if you pack a lot of U-235 atoms into one place, you get a...nuclear chain reaction!</p>

                    <p>Neutron radiation refers to the emission of neutrons as a form of ionizing radiation. Neutrons are subatomic particles that are found in the nucleus of atoms, and they carry no electrical charge. Neutron radiation can be produced through various processes, including nuclear fission, nuclear fusion, and certain types of radioactive decay.

                        <br>Here are some key details about neutron radiation:

                        <br>1. Penetration and Range: Neutrons have high penetration capabilities and can travel through matter more easily than other forms of ionizing radiation such as alpha or beta particles. However, their ability to penetrate depends on their energy level. Neutrons with higher energies can travel longer distances and penetrate more deeply into materials
                        <br>2. Ionizing Power: Neutrons are indirectly ionizing particles. When they interact with atoms in materials, they can transfer energy to the atoms, causing ionization and subsequent damage to biological tissues and materials.
                        <br>3. Biological Effects: Neutron radiation can cause biological damage by ionizing atoms and molecules in living cells, leading to disruptions in cellular structures and DNA. The effects of neutron radiation on living organisms depend on various factors, including the energy and intensity of the neutron radiation, the duration of exposure, and the specific tissues exposed.
                        <br>4. Neutron Activation: Neutron radiation can induce nuclear reactions in materials. When neutrons are absorbed by atomic nuclei, they can cause the nucleus to become unstable and undergo radioactive decay, producing additional forms of radiation and radioactive isotopes. This process is known as neutron activation.
                        <br>5. Neutron Shielding: Shielding against neutron radiation is more complex than shielding against other forms of radiation due to the nature of neutrons. Neutrons can be effectively attenuated by materials that contain hydrogen, such as water or polyethylene, as hydrogen nuclei have a high probability of interacting with neutrons through a process called scattering.
                        <br>6. Detection and Measurement: Specialized instruments such as neutron detectors, including gas-filled proportional counters or scintillation detectors with specific neutron-sensitive materials, are used to detect and measure neutron radiation. These instruments can provide information about the intensity and energy distribution of the neutron radiation.
                        <br>7. Applications: Neutron radiation has various applications in research, industry, and medicine. It is used in fields such as nuclear power, materials science, imaging techniques, and radiation therapy.

                        <p>If each split causes two or more splits, all the power will be released very quickly. This is what happens in a nuclear bomb. In nuclear power reactors, we want each split to cause exactly one more split. This keeps the reaction stable and constant.</p>

                    <p> Proper safety protocols, shielding, and monitoring systems are essential for handling and working with neutron radiation to minimize the associated risks. The level of protection required depends on the specific neutron radiation source, its energy spectrum, and the specific activities being performed.</p>

                    <p>Beta radiation is a type of ionizing radiation consisting of high-energy electrons or positrons. It is emitted during certain types of radioactive decay, specifically beta decay, which involves the transformation of a neutron or a proton within the atomic nucleus.</p>


                    <p>Here are some key details about beta radiation:

                        <br>1. Types of Beta Particles: Beta radiation comes in two forms: beta-minus (β-) and beta-plus (β+).
                        
                        <br>- Beta-Minus (β-) Decay: In β- decay, a neutron within the nucleus is converted into a proton, and an electron (beta particle) and an antineutrino are emitted. The beta particle carries a negative charge (an electron).
                        
                        <br>- Beta-Plus (β+) Decay: In β+ decay, a proton within the nucleus is converted into a neutron, and a positron (beta particle) and a neutrino are emitted. The beta particle carries a positive charge (a positron).
                        
                        <br>2. Penetration and Range: Beta particles have moderate penetration capabilities. They can travel through several meters of air or a few millimeters to centimeters in materials like aluminum or plastic. However, they can be stopped by denser materials like lead or a thick layer of concrete.
                        
                        <br>3. Ionizing Power: Beta particles have moderate ionizing power. As they travel through matter, they can strip off electrons from atoms, leading to the creation of ions and causing damage to biological tissues and materials.
                        
                        <br>4. Energy Transfer: When beta particles interact with matter, they transfer energy through collisions with atoms and molecules. This energy deposition can cause damage to cells, DNA, and other biological molecules, potentially leading to health effects.
                        
                        <br>5. Medical and Industrial Applications: Beta radiation finds applications in various fields. It is used in medical treatments such as radiation therapy for cancer, where controlled doses of beta-emitting isotopes are targeted at cancerous tissues. Beta radiation is also used in industrial applications such as thickness measurement and quality control in manufacturing processes.
                        
                        <br>6. Detection and Measurement: Specialized detectors, such as Geiger-Muller counters and scintillation detectors, are used to detect and measure beta radiation. These instruments can provide information about the intensity and energy of the beta particles present.
                        
                        <br>7. Radiation Protection: To shield against beta radiation, materials with low atomic numbers, such as plastic or aluminum, are typically used. The thickness of the shielding required depends on the energy and intensity of the beta radiation. Personal protective equipment and proper safety protocols are essential when working with beta-emitting sources.</p>

                    <p>
                        Time, distance, and shielding are fundamental principles used in radiation safety to minimize exposure to ionizing radiation. They are known as the "ALARA" principle, which stands for "As Low As Reasonably Achievable."
                        
                        <br>1. Time: Minimizing the duration of exposure to radiation helps reduce the total dose received. The less time spent in the presence of a radiation source, the lower the potential for radiation exposure. Workers and individuals are advised to limit their time in radiation areas, and appropriate work practices and procedures should be implemented to minimize exposure time.
                        
                        <br>2. Distance: Increasing the distance between oneself and a radiation source can significantly reduce the radiation dose received. The intensity of radiation decreases rapidly as the distance from the source increases due to the inverse square law. Doubling the distance from a radiation source reduces the dose rate to one-fourth of its original value. Maintaining a safe distance from a radiation source is crucial for minimizing exposure.
                        
                        <br>3. Shielding: Shielding involves using appropriate materials to block or attenuate radiation. Different types of radiation require specific shielding materials due to their unique properties.
                        
                        <br>It's important to note that shielding is not always feasible or practical in all situations. In such cases, time and distance play a crucial role in reducing radiation exposure. The appropriate combination of time, distance, and shielding is determined based on the specific radiation source, its energy, the surrounding environment, and the tasks being performed.
                        
                        <br>sRadiation safety guidelines and regulations, along with proper training, ensure that individuals working with or around radiation sources understand and follow the principles of time, distance, and shielding to minimize their exposure and maintain a safe working environment.

                    <p>In fact, nuclear accidents are extremely unlikely and altogether cause far fewer deaths than fossil fuels (mainly because burning fossil fuels releases deadly air pollution).</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <h3>Can we recycle nuclear waste to use as fuel?</h3>
                    <img src="img/K.png" alt = "K">

                    <p>Natural uranium is made up of around 99.3% U-238 and 0.7% U-235. But, we need the uranium rods in reactors to contain 4-5% U-235. When creating this enriched fuel, we leave a large amount of U-238 behind.

                    <br>What if we could recycle this waste and use it to make more energy?

                    <br>Travelling Wave Reactors (TWR) are designed to use depleted Uranium-238 as fuel. TWRs are a type of fast reactor, which means that they don’t have to use a moderator to slow neutrons down, as discussed in the last chapter. The fast neutrons are not very good at initiating fission in the U-235, but U-238 can absorb them.

                    <br>The key idea behind these reactors is that they make their own fuel. This can look as follows:</p>
                    <img src="img/L.png" alt = "L">

                    <p>U-238 can’t power normal nuclear reactors but in a TWR reactor the neutrons are moving quickly which means U-238 can absorb one. The U-238 turns into U-239 which then decays, eventually forming an isotope of plutonium (P-239). P-239, like U-235, can undergo fission, split and release lots of energy. This is what then powers the nuclear fission reactions and creates the heat that ultimately becomes the energy we get out of the reactor. All of this happens within the reactor!

                        <br>TWRs produce 80% less radioactive waste per unit of energy produced (by mass) than conventional reactors and could in principle recycle spent nuclear fuel, but significant research advances are needed for that.
                        
                        <br>Work on TWRs has been ongoing for decades, mostly unsuccessfully. But progress has been made in recent years.</p>


                    <p>5. Do you remember what percentage of natural uranium is U-235?</p>
